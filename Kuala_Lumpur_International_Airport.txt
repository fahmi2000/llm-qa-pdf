KLIA is the largest and busiest airport in Malaysia. In 2020, it handled
13,156,363 passengers, 505,184 tonnes of cargo and 124,529 aircraft
movements. It is the world's 23rd-busiest airport by total passenger
traffic.
The airport is operated by Malaysia Airports (MAHB) Sepang Sdn Bhd
and is the major hub of Malaysia Airlines, MASkargo, Batik Air
Malaysia, UPS Airlines and World Cargo Airlines, and the major
operating base of AirAsia and AirAsia X.

History
IATA: KUL · ICAO: WMKK · WMO: 48650

Background
The ground breaking ceremony for Kuala Lumpur International Airport
(KLIA) took place on 1 June 1993[2] when the government under Tun
Dr Mahathir decided that the existing Kuala Lumpur airport, then
known as Subang International Airport (now Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah
Airport) could not handle future demand. The construction of the airport
was done mainly by a few state owned construction companies as well
as Ekovest Berhad – helmed by Tan Sri Datuk Lim Kang Hoo. It was
created as part of the Multimedia Super Corridor, a grand development
plan for Malaysia. The chief architect who designed the new airport
terminal was the Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa.[3]
Upon KLIA's completion, Subang Airport's Terminal 1 building was
demolished. Malaysia Airports agreed to redevelop the remaining
Terminal 3 to create a specialist airport for turboprop and charter planes
surrounded by a residential area and a business park.[4] The IATA
airport code KUL was transferred from Subang Airport, which
currently handles only turboprop aircraft, general aviation and military
aircraft.

Current site
The airport's site spans 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi) 2[5] of former
agricultural land and is one of the world's largest airport sites. An
ambitious three-phase development plan anticipates KLIA to have three
runways and two terminals each with two satellite terminals.[6] Phase
One involved the construction of the main terminal and one satellite
terminal, giving a capacity of 25 million passengers, and two full service
runways. The Phase One airport had sixty contact piers, twenty remote
parking bays with eighty aircraft parking positions, four maintenance

Grand opening
Kuala Lumpur International Airport was officially inaugurated by the
tenth Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Tuanku Ja'afar of Negeri Sembilan, on 27
June 1998 at 20:30 MST. The first domestic arrival was Malaysia
Airlines flight MH1263 from Kuantan at 07:10 MST. The first
international arrival was Malaysia Airlines flight MH188 from Malé at
07:30 MST. The first domestic departure was Malaysia Airlines flight
MH1432 to Langkawi at 07:20 MST; the first international departure
was Malaysia Airlines flight MH84 to Beijing at 09:00 MST.[7]

Inauguration
The inauguration of the airport was marked with numerous problems.
The aerobridge and bay allocation systems broke down, with queues
building up throughout the airport and the baggage handling breaking
down. Bags were lost, and there were waits of over five to seven
hours.[8] Most of these issues were remedied eventually, though the
baggage handling system was plagued with problems until it was put up
for a complete replacement tender in 2007.

Malaysia

The airport suffered greatly reduced traffic with the general reduction in
economic activity brought about by the 1997 Asian financial crisis,
September 11 attacks, SARS, bird flu epidemic (Avian flu), the financial
crisis of 2007–2008, the 2009 swine flu pandemic and the COVID-19
pandemic. The airport is also largely overshadowed by the more
internationally renowned Changi Airport located approximately 300
kilometres (190 mi) to the south in Singapore, especially in regards to
connecting flights by various airlines or Malaysians especially living in
the southern parts of the country (e.g. Johor) preferring to travel via
Changi rather than at KLIA.

The first year of opening immediately saw reduction of passenger
numbers as some airlines, including All Nippon Airways (resumed on 1
September 2015), British Airways (reinstated on 28 May 2015 until 28
March 2021[9]), Lufthansa (resumed between 28 March 2004[10] until
28 February 2016)[11] and Northwest Airlines, terminated their lossmaking services to KLIA. KLIA's first full year of operations in 1999,
in its Phase One manifestation (capacity of 25 million passengers per
year), saw only 13.2 million passengers.[12] Passenger numbers
eventually increased to 21.1 million in 2004 and 47 million in 2013[13]
— though short of the originally estimated 25 million passengers per
year by 2003.

Runways

Kuala Lumpur International Airport has three parallel runways (14L/32R; 14R/32L;
15/33[16]).
The current three runway system is capable of handling 78 landings per hour and is
expected to increase to 108 landings per hour once upgrading of the Kuala Lumpur
Flight Information Region is completed in 2019.[17] These runways operate on
different departure/arrival modes according to the air traffic requirements.[18]

Airport Layout

Terminals
Kuala Lumpur International Airport comprises two main terminals: the original
terminal, Terminal 1, previously known simply as "KLIA"; and the newer Terminal 2
(formerly KLIA2). Terminal 1 was designed by Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa,
with an emphasis of natural lighting within the airport complex. Spanning 38.4m along

The check-in counters at KLIA
Terminal 1. The roof structure was
inspired by traditional Malay
architecture.

a grid pattern allowing for future expansions, the abstract symbolic architecture by the late Kisho Kurokawa encompasses the
Islamic geometry and cutting-edge technology with the tropical rainforest in mind.[25]

KLIA Terminal 1
Main Terminal Building
The KLIA Main Terminal Building (MTB) now also referred to as KLIA Main is
located in between the two runways. The floor area of the terminal covers 390,000 m2
(4,200,000 sq ft) and the building consists of 39 square roof units, which enables
future expansion of the building. There are a total of 216 check-in counters, located in
6 different islands, identified by the letters A – M (excluding I). Multi check-in services
are available, designed for the use of all passengers arriving, departing or in transit.
Self check in facilities are available in this airport since 2007,[26][27] and KLM was the
first airline to use the Common-use self-service kiosks. The contact pier is an extension
Malaysia Airlines at Contact Pier
of the main terminal building with gates marked with prefix A and B for domestic
departures, G and H for international flights. The gate allocation is based on
operational requirements, although it has been observed that Malaysia Airlines has been operating most of its operations out
from the contact pier.
Satellite Terminal A
The 176,000 square metres (1,890,000 sq ft) satellite building accommodates
international flights departing and arriving at KLIA. Passengers have to travel to the
satellite building via bus. Formerly there was an aero train but this is not in service as
of March 2023. There is a wide array of duty-free shops and prestige brand boutiques
in the satellite building. This includes international brands such as Burberry, Harrods,
Montblanc, Salvatore Ferragamo, and Hermes. Among all international labels available
within the terminal, some boutiques such as Harrods are only available in the airport. A
number of restaurants and international airlines' lounges are available as well as an
Airside Transit Hotel.

Interior of the Satellite Terminal

Within the terminal, wireless internet (Wi-Fi) is provided free of charge. The terminal
also has prayer rooms, showers and massage service. Various lounge areas are
provided, some including children's play areas and movie lounge, broadcasting movie and sport channels.[28] The terminal
also features a natural rainforest in the middle of the terminal, exhibiting the Malaysian rainforests.
Under Malaysia Airports Berhad retail optimisation plan, the retail space in satellite terminal A will be further optimised to
increase its revenue derived from commercial space rental and a percentage of sale receipts to 50% by year 2010 which
currently stands at 35%. Some notable improvements that will be seen after the refurbishments will be the Jungle
Boardwalk[29] which will be the first of its kind in the world and larger mezzanine floor to accommodate F&B outlets and
viewing galleries.[30]
The gates in Satellite Terminal A have the prefix C. The Satellite A terminal has 27 boarding gates altogether.[31]

KL City Air Terminal
KL City Air Terminal, sometimes known as Kuala Lumpur City Air Terminal or KL CAT, located at KL Sentral, is a virtual
extension of KL International Airport where city check-in services are provided. KL City Air Terminal is recognised by the
International Air Transport Association (IATA) and carries the IATA designation XKL. Currently there are only three airlines
providing city check-in services: Cathay Pacific, Malaysia Airlines and Malindo Air.[32]

KLIA Terminal 2 (Formerly known as KLIA2)
Built at approximately RM4 billion, it is the largest purpose-built terminal optimised for low-cost carriers in response to the
exponential growth of low-cost travel in the region. It was built to replace the previous Low Cost Carrier Terminal (LCCT).
KLIA2 began its operations on 2 May 2014, and all flight operations at LCCT were moved to KLIA2 by 9 May 2014.[33][34]

As part of its development, a third runway (Runway 15/33) and a new air traffic
control tower (Tower West) were built to support its operation. klia2 has an initial
capacity of 45 million passengers per year. The terminal has a built-up area of 257,845
sqm with 68 departure gates, 10 remote stands, 80 aerobridges, includes a retail space
of 32,000 sqm to accommodate a total of 220 retail outlets.[35] The main terminal
building of klia2 is connected with its satellite piers with a skybridge, making it the
first airport in Asia with such facility.[36] klia2 is certified with Leadership in Energy &
Environmental Design (LEED).

The terminal logo

Check-in counters are divided into 8 rows located in 4 islands, each row identified by
the letters S – Z. Boarding gates are located in 5 piers, indicated by the letters J and K
for domestic flights, and L, P and Q for international flights. Piers J, K and L are
connected directly to the main terminal building, while Piers P and Q are accessible via
the skybridge. Piers K and L are physically the same pier and share the same gates, but
with waiting lounges on different levels (Level 1A for K and Level 2 for L). For
international flights, the access door from Pier K is sealed off, while for domestic
flights, the access door from Pier L is sealed off instead.[37][38]
At present, inter-terminal connection is provided on the landside at Gateway@klia2
complex and there are provisions for future airside inter-terminal connection.[39]

KLIA2 main lobby

Gateway@klia2
Gateway@klia2 is an integrated shopping complex that is connected to the main klia2 terminal building. It has a 350,000
square feet of net lettable space spanning over four levels. The transport hub at Gateway@klia2 links klia2 to the KLIA
Ekspres and KLIA Transit service, with allotted pick-up and drop-off areas for coaches, taxis, rented vehicles and private
transportation.[40]
Gateway@klia2 hosts an 8-storey car park that directly adjoins klia2. There are 6,000 covered parking lots at Blocks A and B
and another 5,500 lots at car park D (KLIA2 parking rate (https://parking.com.my/item/klia2-kuala-lumpur-international-airpor
t-2/)). Shuttle buses are available to take the public from the car park D to the terminal.[41] The first capsule transit hotel in Asia
named as the Capsule by Container Hotel is also located at Gateway@klia2. Gateway@klia2 is managed by WCT Holdings
Berhad.[42]

Former Low Cost Carrier Terminal (LCCT)
The now defunct 36,000 square metres (390,000 sq ft) low cost carrier terminal (LCCT) was opened at Kuala Lumpur
International Airport on 23 March 2006 to cater for the growing number of users of low-cost airlines, especially the passengers
of Malaysia's "no-frills" airline AirAsia. The terminal was designed and built in accordance to the low cost carrier business
model, with limited terminal amenities. As requested by the low-cost airlines, the terminal did not provide aerobridges, nor
were there transfer facilities, rail connections, and the other facilities provided in a fully fledged terminal. LCCT was located
within the Air Support Zone; it ceased operations on 9 May 2014, and all low-cost carrier flights subsequently operated out of
KLIA2.[43]

Ground transportation
Inter-terminal transportation
The Aerotrain is an automated people mover (APM) that connects the airside of KLIA
Main Terminal Building (MTB) and the Satellite Building. Each 250-person capacity
train can transport 3,000 passengers per hour in each direction at up to 56 km/h
(35 mph). These three-car driverless trains run on elevated rail and under the taxiways.
The journey takes under two minutes. The Aerotrain operates between three and fiveminute intervals between terminal. Automatic train controls manage the operation of
the entire Aerotrain system, controlling the speeds, headways, stops and door openings
in stations, and integrating functions that enhance the reliability and performance of the
system.[152]

Aerotrain station in Satellite Building

External connections
Rail
Kuala Lumpur International Airport is linked to the KL Sentral transportation hub in the city centre by the 57 km (35 mi) long
Express Rail Link (ERL). There are two ERL stations at the airport: KLIA station at the Main Terminal Building and klia2
station at Gateway@klia2.
Bus
Kuala Lumpur International Airport has bus terminals in both KLIA and KLIA2 building which serves local buses, city
express and intercity express buses to various destination in Kuala Lumpur, Klang Valley and also various parts of Peninsular
Malaysia, as well as shuttles between KLIA and KLIA2, terminals to Long Term Car Park and terminals to Mitsui Outlet Park.
KLIA bus terminal is located on Ground Floor, Block C and KLIA 2 bus terminal is located on Level 1 of the terminal.
Ticketing counters are present in the terminals.
Buses to the Kuala Lumpur city mainly goes to KL Sentral railway station and Integrated Southern Terminal bus terminal
(TBS), both a prominent transport hub of Kuala Lumpur, as well as various other places like Pudu Sentral, Jalan Ipoh and
Jalan Pekeliling Terminal. There are also buses to parts of other Klang Valley cities like Shah Alam (Section 17 terminal),
Klang (AEON Bukit Tinggi) as well as Putra Heights LRT station. Popular providers are Aerobus, Airport Coach and Jetbus.

Intercity services are available to Penang, Ipoh, Yong Peng (central Johor), Johor Bahru, Malacca and Sitiawan (Perak). Local
buses are also available to Nilai and Banting, with SmartSelangor free shuttle available to Banting, Tanjung Sepat and Salak
Tinggi.
Car
Kuala Lumpur International Airport is mainly served by tolless KLIA Expressway (Federal Route 26) which is an 11 kilometre
direct road from KLIA Interchange of ELITE Expressway (E6) to both KLIA and KLIA2. The expressway also has
connection to:
KLIA Outer Ring Road (Federal 27) to KLIA mosque and Sepang International Circuit
Labohan Dagang–Nilai Road (Federal 32) to Banting, Nilai and Salak Tinggi
The further end of the expressway leads to tolled ELITE Expressway, which connects it to the PLUS expressway networks
(E1 North-South Expressway-North, E1 New Klang Valley Expressway and E2 North-South Expressway-South) which links
to most of Klang Valley's major townships and further to Peninsular Malaysia's west coast states, to the extent of the border
with Thailand and Singapore.

Expansion and developments
Plans
With the slight modification of the masterplan, the future Terminal 2's satellite terminal
will be combined into one satellite terminal. The expansion of Terminal 2's satellite
terminal will be exactly the same as Terminal 1's (the current Main Terminal) satellite
terminal, where initially the satellite terminal will have four arms, and another four
arms when the terminal reached its capacity. There is sufficient land and capacity to
develop facilities to handle up to 97.5 million passengers a year, four runways by 2020
and two mega-terminals, each linked with satellite terminals.[6]
